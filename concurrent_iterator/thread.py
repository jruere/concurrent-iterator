    This is different from merging multiple independent producers in that
    `maxsize` limit applies to the total output, not individual producers.

    The 'policy' parameter specify the buffering policy of the producer.
    Possible values are 'linear' and 'ring'. If 'linear' is selected,
    items from different producers are queued into a single linear queue; as a
    consequence, the producer stops consumption of new items from the threads
    once the queue gets full. In the case of 'ring' policy, the oldest items in
    the queue will be overwritten by the new ones

    Exceptions terminate a generator (PEP 255) but in this case we have multiple
    generators. The way this is resolved is that the first generator to raise an
    exception terminates the entire MultiProducer.
    The rationale for this is to prevent hiding exceptions.

    This implementation is useful for IO bound consumers.
